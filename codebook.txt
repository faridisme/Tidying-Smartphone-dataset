###TIDY DATASET

	180 observations of 30 subjects performing 6 activities
	68 variables

###VARIABLES

	Subject : values from 1 to 30 representing unique subjects performing the activity for each window sample

	Activity : Factor variable represents 6 activities performed as below
	1 WALKING - Subject is walking
	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS - Subject is walking upstairs
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS - Subject is walking downstairs
	4 SITTING - Subject is sitting
	5 STANDING - Subject is standing
	6 LAYING - Subject is laying

The remaining 66 variables denote averages of the mean and standard deviation for features that were made for each subject and activity. Features are normalised and bounded within [-1,1]. Before normalisation, the acceleration signal was in standard gravity units 'g', and gyroscope signal was in units radians/second.

###TRANSFORMATIONS

Source data was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

R script (run_analysis.R) was used to transform the source data to the tidy dataset according to the following steps:

	1. Mean and standard deviation of features were extracted from features.txt
	2. Subject variables (i.e. subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt) and activity variables (i.e. y_train.txt and y_test.txt) were left joined to respective train and test set (i.e. X_train.txt and X_test.txt)
	3. Training and test sets were merged to create one data set
	4. Activity labels were replaced based on activity_labels.txt
	5. Average the mean and standard deviation for features that were made for each subject and activity
